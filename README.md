# ao3-shoosh

Interface for generating the CSS you need to mute a user or hide a work from your search results on Archive of Our Own.

**What this is not:** 
- A tool to "block" users in the sense that they are prevented from interacting with you, or you are prevented from seeing their profile if you navigate to it.
- Something that requires access to your account or will change it in any way.

**What this is:**
- A work in progress.

## To do:

- [ ] Add detailed README
- [ ] Add AO3.js (pending release)
- [x] Frontend skeleton 
- [ ] More meat on frontend skeleton
- [ ] Proof of concept: "hide work" process (does not require AO3.js)
